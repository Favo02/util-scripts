without actually uploading them, but searching for the hash.
If the photo IS uploaded and -d/--delete flag is specified, it is deleted from the local directory.

Usage:
    python check-uploaded.py <photos_folder> [-d | --delete]

Environment variables (can be set in .env file):
    URL - Immich server URL (e.g., https://immich.example.com)
    API_KEY - Immich API key

CLI arguments:
    photos_folder - Path to the folder containing images to check
    -d, --delete  - Delete files that are already uploaded (optional)
